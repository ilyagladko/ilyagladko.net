# ilyagladko.net

This is a storage / backup / landfill repo for my personal portfolio / playground / blog / page.
Nothing fancy to see here. For some facny to see go to http://ilyagladko.net

The site is in a constant work in progress beta version never final state. If you find bugs or got suggestions on improvements, write em down and send away. I'm open to the internet of thoughts.
